## 📚 Overview

This project shows how to fine-tune GPT-2 using the Hugging Face `transformers` library. You can train the model on your own dataset and generate text that mimics its structure and style.

- ✅ Uses `transformers` + `datasets` from Hugging Face
- ✅ Trains with `Trainer` API
- ✅ Pushes model to GitHub with Git LFS
- ✅ Includes an interactive chat interface
